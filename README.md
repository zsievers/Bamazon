# Bamazon


Bamazon is a CLI node / mySQL project that mimics an Amazon like store front application. 

<li>My Goal with this project was to combine mySQL with node.js to perform CRUD operations into the database. </li>

<li>This project forced me to improve my understanding of the javascript logic with implementing if/else statements and basic use of mySQL workbench. </li>

<li>With this project being a CLI application, take a look at my demonstration video by clicking the image. Thanks for viewing my project!</li>
